<!--&lt;!&ndash;    This component is a special component available only in Vue&ndash;&gt;-->
<!--&lt;!&ndash;    It has the same function as the tag <a></a>, but it's reactive&ndash;&gt;-->
<!--&lt;!&ndash;    Meaning that the page isn't being refreshed, and we're dynamically going to the page we want&ndash;&gt;-->
<!--&lt;!&ndash;    It has a mandatory props 'to', where we're writing the path of the component&ndash;&gt;-->
<!--&lt;!&ndash;    So when we click on the content of these router links, they'll take us to these pages&ndash;&gt;-->
<!--    We will comment this router links, because we're going to use them other way-->
